i can't believe you're really doing a triathlon next week ! how are you training for it ?
wow . what time do you finish running ?
where do you swim ?
what about cycling ?
what if it rains ?
wow , good luck Jackson !
Sure , just let me know if they ever start my kind of triathlon : sleeping , eating and watching TV . Because i'm already in perfect shape for that


i get up early every day to run . Usually i'm awake by four thirsty or five o'clock , and then i run 10 miles .
i run for about an hour , and then i swim until it's time to go to work.
thankfully , there's a pool near my office , so i use that .
i cycle on the weekends. i spend pretty much all of Saturday and Sunday cycling around my neighborhood.
well , i go to the gym and use an exercise bike on rainy days
why don't you join me next time ? it would be fun to have a workout buddy
haha, okay bros
